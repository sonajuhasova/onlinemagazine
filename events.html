            Reenacting or living history events usually take place in fields that used to be real battlefields centuries ago or inside castles and historical fortresses. They usually start on Friday evening or Saturday morning with groups marching through the city. People sleep in tents and cook outside as soldiers used to do during wars. Spectators can come and see what it looked like. They can walk through the camp and ask questions. <br>

Captains of groups meet in the middle and discuss conditions. After this battle starts.
