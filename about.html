            History of reenactment started already in ancient Rome. The Romans staged recreation of their famous battles within their amphitheaters. In the Middle Ages people used to stage various themes from Ancient Rome. Reenactment started being popular in the 17th century in England. The first reenacting battle was staged in 1638 by Lord James ‘Jimmy’ Dunn of Coniston. It was a battle between Christian and Muslim forces. In the 19th century happened that reenactment became widespread. Romanticism in England supported the reenacting of the Napoleonic War, mainly the Battle of Waterloo. Veterans of American Civil War recreated battles to remember those who fell and to teach others what was it all about. In Russia, people recreate the Siege of Sevastopol or the Battle of Borodino to remember important parts of their history.
