            Reenacting groups
        </h1>
        <div class="article">
            Reenacting groups usually consist of ten to twenty members. Large groups can have even fifty to a hundred members. Some reenactors participate as individuals, usually due to various reasons, for example, they live too far from any other group or work abroad. <br>

            </div>
            Groups usually have trainings on a weekly basis. They meet and practice fencing, learn military orders and work with historical weapons. <br>

            Every reenactor has to have his costume and his weapons, although they can borrow it, usually reenactors like to have their own. It is very complicated to get all components of their costumes which are needed, so it usually takes a long time to purchase all of it. This means uniform or historical costume, coats, hats, leather shoes, bags, swords, guns, armors and other accessories. Most of them are often made on custom orders.
