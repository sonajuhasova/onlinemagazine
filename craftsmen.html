            The importance of craftsmen's work
        </h1>
        <p class="article">
            Craftsmen are very important for a reenactment. Equipment which reenactors need is not sold in shops. All costumes, weapons and accessories require skillful craftsmen. <br>

            Blacksmiths, tailors or hatters are no longer common occupations. Therefore, it is very hard to find those, who are able to make historically correct items. It is necessary to use only materials which were available centuries ago as well. Some of them are very rare nowadays. <br>

            During reenactment events, they usually present their work at market squares. For spectators, it is an unusual experience to see swords and armors created in front of their eyes.
